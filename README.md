## About the Project

This app has been developed during the lab *PADS x Celonis* in summer semester 2023.
The app solves different problems in the domain of Object-centric Process Mining, including

* Importing object-centric event logs (`.jsonocel` or `.csv`)
* Filtering by object types and activity names
* Discovering object-centric petri nets
* Computing cases (*process executions*) and variants, including displaying them as an event-object graph
* Computing object-centric KPIs such as pooling or lagging time [^opera]
