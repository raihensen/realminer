## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 - git clone git@git.rwth-aachen.de:rhensen/pads-x-celonis-ocpm.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. [Optional] Set up the database and configure connection settings in `src\preferences.json'.

## Usage
1. Prepare your process data in the required format.
2. Change directory to the Src folder:
 - cd src\
3. Run the application:
 - python main.py
4. Upload Your Event Log, and follow the Instructions appearing on screen.
   
## Features
The app solves different problems in the domain of Object-centric Process Mining, including:

- Importing object-centric event logs (`.jsonocel` or `.csv`)
- Filtering by object types and activity names
- Discovering object-centric petri nets
- Variants and trends analysis : Computing cases (*process executions*) and variants, including displaying them as an event-object graph [^cases_and_variants]
- Computing object-centric KPIs such as pooling or lagging time [^opera]
- Interactive process visualization
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- Process conformance checking
- Exporting analysis results in various formats

## Examples
### Example 1: Analyzing Purchase Order Process
1. Prepare the purchase order data in jsonocel format.
2. Run the application:
    - python main.py
3. Analyze the process variants, identify trends, and assess performance metrics.
