    "# Drag-and-drop support for Tkinter\n",
    "\n",
    "from https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.11/Lib/tkinter/dnd.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very preliminary.  I currently only support dnd *within* one\n",
    "application, between different windows (or within the same window).\n",
    "I am trying to make this as generic as possible -- not dependent on\n",
    "the use of a particular widget or icon type, etc.  I also hope that\n",
    "this will work with Pmw.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable an object to be dragged, you must create an event binding\n",
    "for it that starts the drag-and-drop process. Typically, you should\n",
    "bind `<ButtonPress>` to a callback function that you write. The function\n",
    "should call Tkdnd.dnd_start(source, event), where 'source' is the\n",
    "object to be dragged, and 'event' is the event that invoked the call\n",
    "(the argument to your callback function).  Even though this is a class\n",
    "instantiation, the returned instance should not be stored -- it will\n",
    "be kept alive automatically for the duration of the drag-and-drop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When a drag-and-drop is already in process for the Tk interpreter, the\n",
    "call is *ignored*; this normally averts starting multiple simultaneous\n",
    "dnd processes, e.g. because different button callbacks all `dnd_start()`.\n",
    "The object is *not* necessarily a widget -- it can be any\n",
    "application-specific object that is meaningful to potential\n",
    "drag-and-drop targets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Potential drag-and-drop targets are discovered as follows.  Whenever\n",
    "the mouse moves, and at the start and end of a drag-and-drop move, the\n",
    "Tk widget directly under the mouse is inspected.  This is the target\n",
    "widget (not to be confused with the target object, yet to be\n",
    "determined).  If there is no target widget, there is no dnd target\n",
    "object.  If there is a target widget, and it has an attribute\n",
    "dnd_accept, this should be a function (or any callable object).  The\n",
    "function is called as `dnd_accept(source, event)`, where 'source' is the\n",
    "object being dragged (the object passed to `dnd_start()` above), and\n",
    "'event' is the most recent event object (generally a `<Motion>` event;\n",
    "it can also be `<ButtonPress>` or `<ButtonRelease>`).  If the `dnd_accept()`\n",
    "function returns something other than `None`, this is the new dnd target\n",
    "object.  If `dnd_accept()` returns `None`, or if the target widget has no\n",
    "`dnd_accept` attribute, the target widget's parent is considered as the\n",
    "target widget, and the search for a target object is repeated from\n",
    "there.  If necessary, the search is repeated all the way up to the\n",
    "root widget.  If none of the target widgets can produce a target\n",
    "object, there is no target object (the target object is `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target object thus produced, if any, is called the new target\n",
    "object.  It is compared with the old target object (or None, if there\n",
    "was no old target widget).  There are several cases ('source' is the\n",
    "source object, and 'event' is the most recent event object):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the old and new target objects are `None`.  Nothing happens.\n",
    "- The old and new target objects are the same object.  Its method\n",
    "`dnd_motion(source, event)` is called.\n",
    "- The old target object was None, and the new target object is not `None`.  The new target object's method `dnd_enter(source, event)` is called.\n",
    "- The new target object is None, and the old target object is not `None`.  The old target object's method `dnd_leave(source, event)` is called.\n",
    "- The old and new target objects differ and neither is `None`.  The old target object's method `dnd_leave(source, event)`, and then the new target object's method `dnd_enter(source, event)` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, the new target object replaces the old one, and the\n",
    "Tk mainloop proceeds.  The return value of the methods mentioned above\n",
    "is ignored; if they raise an exception, the normal exception handling\n",
    "mechanisms take over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drag-and-drop processes can end in two ways: a final target object\n",
    "is selected, or no final target object is selected.  When a final\n",
    "target object is selected, it will always have been notified of the\n",
    "potential drop by a call to its `dnd_enter()` method, as described\n",
    "above, and possibly one or more calls to its `dnd_motion()` method; its\n",
    "`dnd_leave()` method has not been called since the last call to\n",
    "`dnd_enter()`.  The target is notified of the drop by a call to its\n",
    "method `dnd_commit(source, event)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If no final target object is selected, and there was an old target\n",
    "object, its `dnd_leave(source, event)` method is called to complete the\n",
    "dnd sequence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, the source object is notified that the drag-and-drop process\n",
    "is over, by a call to `source.dnd_end(target, event)`, specifying either\n",
    "the selected target object, or `None` if no target object was selected.\n",
    "The source object can use this to implement the commit action; this is\n",
    "sometimes simpler than to do it in the target's `dnd_commit()`.  The\n",
    "target's `dnd_commit()` method could then simply be aliased to\n",
    "`dnd_leave()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time during a dnd sequence, the application can cancel the\n",
    "sequence by calling the `cancel()` method on the object returned by\n",
    "`dnd_start()`.  This will call `dnd_leave()` if a target is currently\n",
    "active; it will never call `dnd_commit()`."
